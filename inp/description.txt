AutoMechanic Input File Structure:

1.	Run.dat

Synopsis: Outlines all of the calculations that AutoMech codes will perform
Broadly, the user describes a set of reactions or species to investigate, and set of "procedures" that are used to generate the required data.

Sections:
    run section [required]:
        This section is a list of species or reactions that the code will operate on

        - input section (gives some input info for the reactions and species (mech specific)) 
            ids: set what ids are used, either just the input, or our sorted speices
            rxn: give a mechanism file type
            spc: give the species file type
        - three reactions:
            pes: perform calculations on all species of desired channels and PESs
            ts: perform calculations on a transition state of a desired channels and PESs
            wells: perform calculations on the entrance and exit channel wells of desired channel and PES
          one species            
            spc: perform calculations on a set of species
          one of the above is required (require maybe just one)

            In each of these sections indices are given describing what things to look at

    proc section [one required]
        - jobs section:
            Lists out all of the jobs to be done
        - model:
            user-input model used to calculate rates/thermo and can also help set the electronic structure tasks
        - es_tsks:
            set what electronic structure calculations are to be done in the run, including the order
                (a) 'models': use the models to schedule the tasks (no control) 
                (b) 'input': the tasks are done as prescribed by the user
        - options:
            set special options for the run


2.	Model.dat

Synopsis: Describes the kinetics and thermochemistry models that are used to compute rates/thermos.

    Here the user specifies one or more model sections that set out how partition functions are calculated

    model model_string_id
        pf(
            *list of pf models
        )
        eslvl(
            *list of information with the level of electronic structure theory
        )
    end 


3.	Theory.dat

Synopsis: Describes the electronic structure methods used for the calculations
    
Here the user specifies one or more model sections that set out how partition functions are calculated
    
    model theory_string_id
            *list of parameters for running electronic structure calculations
    end 



4.	Species.dat

Synopsis: Lists of species with accompanying mechanism  

Can either use a .csv file for simple input

Use a format similar to amech for describing more minor information. This is used

Both formats have to use a species name as well as a chemical identifier.


5.	Reactions.dat

Synopsis: List of reactions in a mechanism

Mechanism file that
